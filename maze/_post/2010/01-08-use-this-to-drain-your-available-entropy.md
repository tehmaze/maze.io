title: Use this to drain your available entropy
---
Tired of the huge amounts of available entropy generated by your RNG being
wasted? Here is the solution:

    :::bash
    #!/bin/sh
    set -e
    DIR=$(mktemp -t -d rsa-art-XXXXXX)
    trap "rm -f $DIR/key*; rmdir $DIR" EXIT HUP INT QUIT TERM

    while :
    do
        ART=$(ssh-keygen -t rsa -f $DIR/key -N "" | tail -n 11)
        rm -f $DIR/key
        /bin/echo -e "\x1Bc"
        echo "$ART"
    done

It even gives you very neat "RSA ASCII art" :-)
