[Habbie](http://7bits.nl/blog/) posted a funny Python quote, which I must share
with you:

    <kandinski> I have created a motherfucker.py module that does nothing, really
    <kandinski> but now I can start my homework by typing:
    <kandinski> import nltk, motherfucker
    <kandinski> it makes me feel better
