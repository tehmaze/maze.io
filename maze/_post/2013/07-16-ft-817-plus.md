We've had the idea for quite a while to build a micro controller based
extension unit for the [Yaesu FT-817](http://ow.ly/n0SOO) line of radios. These
rigs are really nice for mobile QRP use, but their display is quite limited.
[Several](https://sites.google.com/site/g0ftdradio/home/ft817-buddy-box)
[other](https://wiki.bitlair.nl/Pages/Projects/FT-817_Buddy)
[people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txned0p69q4) have implemented some form
of containment unit for their rig.
Luckily all the FT-8X7 radios come with a (serial) CAT interface port which can
be interfaced pretty easily with a PC or a micro controller with an RS232 to
TTL level converter, such as a MAX232. Also an
[extra](http://www.qsl.net/zl1vk/YaesuFT-817Display.pdf)
[display](http://8ch9azbsfifz.github.io/arduino_ft817/) has been done before,
this project is about throwing all of these ideas together in a single build.

## Inventory

Of course we need an FT-817 radio, I have an FT-817D, newer version is the
FT-817ND.

### Yaesu FT-817, about &euro; 629,-

I'm using an older Arduino Duemilanove board with an ATmega328 micro
controller, but any Arduino with the same (or bigger) MCU should work fine.

### Arduino with shields, about &euro; 24,-

Also I happened to have an LCD keypad shield laying around, this is a 16x2
character liquid crystal display. The display is a HD44780 clone which is
generally available in all colours of the rainbow, I just have to remember to
buy one with a red/orange back light next time, as they have the highest
efficacy (lumens per dissipated Watt).

The rest of the smaller components are fitted on a protoshield which will
nicely fit in between the Arduino and the LCD controller board.

### RS232 to TTL adaptor board, about &euro; 0.75

The MAX232 integrated cirquit requires two 10 &#230;F capacitors, which could
get quite bulky, but there are very good RS232 to TTL adapter boards available
on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=RS232+to+TTL+Module) (based on a
MAX3233) for as cheap as $0.99. I'll use those to convert the Arduino's digital
pin voltage (of about 3.3V) to match the serial line voltage of 5V.

### Various small components

For interfacing the radio, you'll need a 8-pin DIN connector, which can be
recycled from an old PS/2 keyboard (that's what I used). As I'll be making a
box to house the rig, several of the back connections have to be terminated on
the back of the box, so another &euro 10,- for connectors and a piece of
shielded 50 ohm coax.

### Various pieces of wood

The unit will be housed in a nice wooden box which I can carry around to field
days or for mobile usage.

## The build

This article will get updated once I have pictures of the build :-)

## Demo of the FT-817+ emulator

Here a small video demonstrating the FT-817+ emulator software controlling the
micro controller:
