<h2>Social media</h2>

<p>
  Hi there. Sorry to disappoint you, but I quit using social media platforms
  hosted by corporate America. I've had it with companies that are more than
  happy to sell your soul on your behalf, whether you agree or not. As there is
  no real workable alternative (well, <a
  href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora*</a> has made a good attempt), I'll just stick with using IRC, as I have always done before.
</p>
<p>
  You can find me on <a href="http://freenode.net/">FreeNode</a>, <a
  href="http://www.ircnet.org/">IRCNet</a>, <a
  href="http://efnet.org/">EFNet</a> and <a
  href="http://www.smurfnet.ch/">SmurfNet</a> as <code>maze</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Another way of contacting me is via e-mail, my PGP key id is <code><a href="http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x07E40BB33D63D49047973421ED7B1576294DF221&op=vindex">07E4 0BB3 3D63 D490 4797  3421 ED7B 1576 294D F221</a></code>.
</p>

  Oh, btw, the awesome ANSI social media icon set is made by <a
